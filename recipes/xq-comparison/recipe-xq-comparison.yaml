        Comparison of the cw-EPR spectra of the same substance recorded at 
        X and Q band.
      text: > 
        The splitting observed at Q band and not visible at X band 
        can be attributed to g anisotropy. Furthermore, only conversion 
        of the magnetic field axis to a g axis allows for directly 
        comparing the spectra obtained at different fields and frequencies.
